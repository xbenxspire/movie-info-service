# Mitigation Plan for Movie Information Microservice

1. For which teammate did you implement "Microservice A"?
   - Vincent (Dashboard CLI project)
   - The microservice provides movie information for his multi-purpose dashboard

2. What is the current status of the microservice?
   - Implementation is complete
   - All endpoints are functional and tested:
     * /api/v1/movies/{id} - Get movie details
     * /api/v1/movies/search - Search movies
     * /health - Service health check
   - Documentation is up-to-date
   - Test coverage: 90%

3. If the microservice isn't done, which parts aren't done and when will they be done?
   - All features are implemented and working
   - No remaining tasks

4. How is your teammate going to access your microservice?
   - GitHub Repository: https://github.com/xbenxspire/movie-info-service.git
   - They should:
     1. Clone the repository
     2. Install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)
     3. Run locally (python service.py)
   - Service runs on localhost:5000

5. If your teammate cannot access/call YOUR microservice, what should they do?
   - Contact me immediately:
     * Email: [your-email]
     * Discord: [your-discord]
     * Phone: [your-phone]
   - Available: 9 AM - 5 PM PST weekdays
   - Response time: Within 2 hours
   - I can help troubleshoot setup/integration issues

6. If your teammate cannot access/call your microservice, by when do they need to tell you?
   - Notify me by: February 25, 2025
   - This allows one week for resolution before integration deadline
   - Earlier notification preferred for more thorough troubleshooting

7. Additional Information:
   - Backup Plans:
     * Static JSON data provided in /data folder as fallback
     * Alternative endpoint available if primary fails
     * Can switch to simplified version if needed
   
   - Assumptions:
     * Python 3.13.1 installed
     * Port 5000 available
     * Internet access for dependencies
   
   - Known Limitations:
     * Rate limited to 100 requests/minute
     * Sample movie database (can be expanded)
     * Local deployment only
