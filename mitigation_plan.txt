3. TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
   If unable to access/call the microservice:
   
   a) First Steps:
      - Verify microservice is running (python microservice.py)
      - Check OMDB API key in .env file
      - Test health endpoint: GET http://localhost:5000/health
   
   b) Common Issues:
      - Port 5000 already in use -> Kill process or use different port
      - OMDB API key invalid -> Get new key from omdbapi.com
